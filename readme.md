Load allows the user to enter an exsisting id and load the coresponding atributes.  If the id does not exsist, the system will display a warning message.
If the user enters all the required values and selects update, the system will either update the values choresponding to an exsisting id 
or if the id does not exsist, it will add it to the table.
